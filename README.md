## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. We recommend using the latest LTS version.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/astro-project.git
   cd astro-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Locally

To start the development server and view the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:3000` where you can view your project. The server supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make will automatically update in the browser.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate static files in the `dist` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Deploying to Netlify

To deploy your project to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):

1. **Create a new site on Netlify**: Log in to your Netlify account and click on "New site from Git".

2. **Connect your Git repository**: Select your Git provider and authenticate. Choose the repository for your Astro project.

3. **Configure build settings**:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`

4. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy site" to start the deployment process. Once completed, your site will be live on a Netlify domain.
